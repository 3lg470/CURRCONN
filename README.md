This bash script will get a status of current network connections and extract all TCP and UDP destinations in contact with the machine.

It will then look up details on the owner of the remote IP and print useful information about it (e.g., Org, Location).  

The results are written to netput.txt.

Future enhancments will include Shodan lookups on the remote destinations and website domains associated with the IPs.
